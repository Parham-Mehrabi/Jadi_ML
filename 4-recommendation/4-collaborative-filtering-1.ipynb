    "2. then we need __Similarity Matrix__ where we find out how people are similar to the user (the dude we are going to calculate it for)\n",
    "3. then we multiply similarity matrix to rating matrix for movies which our target hasnt watched yet, the result is __Weighted Ratings Matrix__\n",
    "4. then we __sum up__ all rates for each movie and then __divide the result__ to sum of all the voter's similarity (to target user) score from Similarity Matrix\n",
